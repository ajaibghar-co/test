# mee.tup v1
Join us for dra.ft mee.tup as a follow-up to last week's code poetry jam.

**mee.tup** is more experiments, discussions and ideas around the future of text.
In this mee.tup we collaborate with machines on some quick improv poetry, discuss why it's important to look at computation and poetry together and understand how we can keep growing our community.

## No knowledge of coding required!

We encourage womxn poets, writers, makers, artists, designers and coders to co-author with machines and other humans 👩‍🎤👩‍💻👩‍🎨🦸‍♀️

**Saturday (May-23), 6PM-7PM**
